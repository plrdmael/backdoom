# Backdoom

Backdoom is a retro-style first-person shooter game developed in C++ using the Raylib library. Inspired by the iconic look and feel of *DOOM* and the wave-based *Zombie Mode* from *Call of Duty*, Backdoom combines fast-paced combat, survival mechanics, and a haunting atmosphere. Players must fend off endless waves of zombies, battling for as long as possible in a hellish, pixelated world.
